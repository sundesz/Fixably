# Read me

I have problem while fetching url(it always return Null or false), But I do the task anyway.
When I use the Postman its working.
So I know what kind of result do I get based on Postman

# Run Server

php -S localhost:8000

# Task 3

I need to pass Apple instead of Iphone.
For me Iphone return empty result.
So, after getting Apple result I filter only Iphone result
